## Profile

I have graduated from two highly selective technology-related courses: **Makers Academy**, 16 weeks software development bootcamp, where I learnt to code using the best methodologies and practices in the industry, and **MSc in Management, Information Systems and Digital Innovation at London School of Economics** where I learnt how to combine the social, the organizational and the technological to generate value and benefit. In addition to my technological education, I gained commercial expereience at Bubblo - an early stage start up - where I learnt about continually iterating on a product in response to user data.

During my working experience at Bubblo, I was in charged of creating and maintaining relationships with different venues that were collaborating with the app. That included a wide range of types of venues and managers, from small and more familiar coffee shops to big chains of restaurants allowing me to learn to create trusting relationships with many different stakeholders. Further, my experience of living abroad (In England, where I still reside) has made me face new challenges that continue to develop my communication skills.
