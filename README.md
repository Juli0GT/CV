## Profile

Currently working for Mettrr as a **front end developer** in London, where I have been delivering value since day 1st. Working closely with UI/UX designers, to bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation. Also I've been the lead front end developer in a massive project as the development of a new CRM for internal use. Which has been an invaluable learning experience through all the different stages of a big information systems project. 

Before getting into that job, I have graduated from two highly selective technology-related courses: **Makers Academy**, 16 weeks software development bootcamp, where I learnt to code using the best methodologies and practices in the industry, and **MSc in Management, Information Systems and Digital Innovation at London School of Economics** where I learnt how to combine the social, the organizational and the technological to generate value and benefit. In addition to my technological education, I gained commercial experience at Bubblo - an early stage start up - where I learnt about continually iterating on a product in response to user data.

**I'm looking for a role in front-end development in Berlin** where I can keep consolidating and improving my programming skills, while also gaining a better understanding of the management of the application of technology in the 'real world'.

**Tech Skills:  JavaScript (ES6), React, Vue.js, Node.js, Express, JQuery, Mocha, Chai, Karma, PostgreSQL, Object-Oriented Programming, Agile Methodologies, Test-Driven Development, Software Craftsmanship, Pair Programming, Git, Heroku**.

I am a person driven by curiosity and motivation. My ideal role would be one in which I could continue my personal development, whilst taking on responsibility and creating a positive impact for both the company and the people.

## Skills

#### Team Worker

When I was young I used to play saxophone in a band in which I learnt that group outcomes require more than siloed individual performances. 

Bubblo and Contacto Photo are small companies where I had the privilege to work. The ability of the group to work as a team in both cases had a direct impact on the success. 
At Contacto I was in charge of management of the picture editing. Therefore I always had to have direct and effective collaboration with sales people to reach magazines with the right material before any competitors. 

Also, I've always been referred as a positive person, who spreads happiness and joy in the working place.

#### Logical Reasoning

During my years at high school in Spain, where I had the possibility to chose between different fields of study, I did the Technological one which is focused on pure maths, physics and chemistry. Allowed me to develop strong rational thinking, which was consolidated with my business management studies. 

That mindset has been a great resource during my learning to code journey. When it comes to problem solving, my mathematical thinking allows me to chose the right approach minimizing difficulty and maximazing efficiency. 

Also a useful skill when learning new things. Dividing the task in to manageable pieces, prioritising the important ones and learning them in a rational way, is the process I follow naturally each time I face a new concept.

#### Good Communicator

During my working experience at Bubblo, I was in charged of creating and maintaining relationships with different venues that were collaborating with the app. That included a wide range of types of venues and managers, from small and more familiar coffee shops to big chains of restaurants allowing me to learn to create trusting relationships with many different stakeholders. 

Further, my experience of living abroad (In England, where I still reside) has made me face new challenges that continue to develop my communication skills.
